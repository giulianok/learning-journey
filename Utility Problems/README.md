### Utility Problem

A utility problem is a problem that you should know and solve quickly, you don't really need to think. These problems are things that "we use every day", for example, reverse a linked list.

We need to know them no matter what because they are very useful to solve medium/bigger problems.

To be successful in any interview, you should know all of them! and solve them quickly!
